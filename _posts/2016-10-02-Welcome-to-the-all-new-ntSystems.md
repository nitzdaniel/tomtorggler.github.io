Welcome to our new home on GitHub.
<!--more-->

# Jekyll
This new version is now hosted on GitHub Pages and uses a slightly modified version of the default Minima theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

# Tools
We use the following tools to make this as awesome as possible:

- [Algolia: Search as a Service](https://www.algolia.com/)
- [Favicon Generator](http://realfavicongenerator.net/)
- [Shariff: Share without compromising privacy](https://github.com/heiseonline/shariff)

# Work in progress
This migration is work in progress and therefore not all features the good old ntsystems.it are available as of today.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâs GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
