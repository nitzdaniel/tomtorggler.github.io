# My Setup
My primary work machine [these days](https://ntsystems.it/post/getting-started-with-osx) is a MacBook Pro running macOS Sierra. I thought it would be best to run the docker client on my Mac and use a virtual machine as docker host. So all I had to do my machine, was:

```
$ brew install docker
```
